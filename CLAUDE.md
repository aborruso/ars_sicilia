# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

## Proposal Format

When creating `proposal.md`, use this exact structure to avoid validation warnings:

```markdown
# Change: [Brief description]

## Why
[1-2 sentences on problem/opportunity]

## What Changes
- [Bullet list of changes]
- [Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**]

## Impact
- Affected specs: [list capabilities]
- Affected code: [key files/systems]
```

Optional sections (add after required sections): Timeline, Trade-offs, Out of Scope, Related Changes
